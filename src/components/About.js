      <p className="mb-4">
        Hi, I'm Taahirah Denmark, an aspiring AI/ML Engineer with a strong
        foundation in software development and a passion for pushing the
        boundaries of technology. With over 4 years of experience in building
        scalable, user-centered applications, I’m constantly seeking
        opportunities to innovate and apply cutting-edge AI technologies to
        real-world problems.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Currently, I’m pursuing a degree in Computer Science while working on
        exciting projects that blend AI and machine learning into intuitive
        solutions. My recent work includes developing an AI-powered personal
        assistant and experimenting with natural language processing models.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring the latest advancements
        in AI, reading up on emerging technologies, or working on personal
        projects that blend creativity with code. I also enjoy playing video
        games, which fuels my interest in game development and AI-driven
        experiences. I believe in continuous learning and am always excited to
        take on new challenges in both AI/ML and web development to push the
        boundaries of what’s possible.
